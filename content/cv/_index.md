The following rows form a condensed CV. 
Although not every detail is provided, such as achievements and non-reviewed publications / talks, this should give a rough overview of what I've been doing so far.

While the verification of reactive systems and their software is my primary research interest, I'm also interested in all kinds of constraint satisfaction problems, symbolic AI and reverse engineering.
