What follows is a condensed CV. 
Although many details are omitted, such as non-reviewed publications, this should give a rough overview of what I've been doing so far.

While automated analysis of reactive systems and software is my primary research interest, I'm also interested in all kinds of constraint satisfaction problems, symbolic AI and reverse engineering.
