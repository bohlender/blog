During this time I worked on formal verification of control software from the automation domain and graduated summa cum laude.
In my thesis "Symbolic Methods for Formal Verification of Industrial Control Software" I leverage SMT solving and abstract interpretation to develop fully-automated procedures for proving a program's compliance with various specifications that are relevant or unique to this domain.
