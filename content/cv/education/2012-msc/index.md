I picked electrical engineering as minor subject and graduated with distinction.
My thesis "Accelerating Predicate Abstraction for Probabilistic Automata" proposes a fully symbolic approach to probabilistic reachability checking for Markov decision processes.
The results are implemented in the [Storm](http://www.stormchecker.org/) model checker.
