I was part of the core team of developers responsible for expressing customer-independent, fundamental concepts of the business domain in a JVM-embedded, [proprietary Datalog DSL](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-18500-8_55).
The resulting "model" contained the logic of [WorkforcePlus](https://www.inform-software.com/products/workforceplus), and I was recruited help managing its increasing complexity.
My analysis uncovered concrete deficiencies and misapprehensions in the home-made logic programming paradigm as the root cause.
Thus, my main responsibilities were (re-)engineering of the most problematic business domain concepts at that time, and the introduction of modelling language constructs needed to enable more [principled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) modelling.
