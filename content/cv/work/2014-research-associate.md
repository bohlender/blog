Teaching and working on [Arcade.PLC](https://arcade.embedded.rwth-aachen.de/), a platform for verification of software for industrial controllers, featuring model checking procedures and static analyses.
The work on this project involves abstracting the concrete program semantics to avoid exhaustive exploration of the program's state space, and formalising and exploiting peculiarities of both the properties of interest and the domain.
