With the end of my PhD looming on the horizon, I wanted to get a short CV and some information about me online.
However, I wasn't interested in generic, impersonal solutions, such as the services of career-oriented social networking sites.

I used this opportunity to learn some web development basics, and build a [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) that serves as both a portfolio and an outlet for all things creative.
It's the site you're looking at right now.
