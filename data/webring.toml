title = '''Adjusting our logic PLL to handle I&amp;Q'''
summary = '''Some time ago, I posted an article on how to create a basic logic PLL
in Verilog.  The
design
was simple, basic, and easy to implement in an FPGA.  It worked by tracking
the most significant bit of any
sinewave
given to it, giving it a nice gain invariance whic…'''
