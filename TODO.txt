- Icons not showing up in FF 69.0.2 on SurfaceBook2 (but everywhere else)
- Temporary 404 page
- Proper 404 page
  - Trainer Scroller?
  - flickering nixie tubes? 0.00404 -- the requested page does not exist in this timeline
  - doom font 404 & fire effect?
  - morsecode?
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/VaporwaveAesthetics/comments/cu79m4/maintenance_is_being_preformed/?)

- Fix tag padding-top being off in _some_ versions of IE11
- Custom syntax highlighting theme (matching the site's colours)
- Favicon / Logo
- Let pagination link to latest-posts#title ?
- Table of contents in (longer) posts, e.g. if #sections>2 ?

- Proper SMTLIB syntax highlighting (add to chroma)
- Close lightbox on Esc? Needs JS :/
- Tweak look for HighDPI ?
- Make template-generated source readable
- Refactor CSS ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- Better images than the portrait for opengraph

- Report bug/inconsistency:
  - .Site.Title is not an alias of .Site.Params.title but templates refer to both
  - .Site.Title in RSS template
  - .Site.Params.title in opengraph template

Unlikely
========
- Twitter cards -- similar to opengraph data ? Needs Twitter account for approval :/
