Nice to have
============
- Fix tag padding-top being off in _some_ versions of IE11
- Custom syntax highlighting theme (matching the site's colours)
- Favicon / Logo
- Let pagination link to latest-posts#title ?
- Table of contents in (longer) posts, e.g. if #sections>2 ?

- Proper SMTLIB syntax highlighting (add to chroma)
- Close lightbox on Esc? Needs JS :/
- Tweak look for HighDPI ?
- Make template-generated source readable
- Refactor CSS ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- Get rid of KaTeX JS -- branch hugo & prerender math
- Better images than the portrait for opengraph
- Use schema.org microdata to alter the appearance of search engine results

- Report bug/inconsistency:
  - .Site.Title is not an alias of .Site.Params.title but templates refer to both
  - .Site.Title in RSS template
  - .Site.Params.title in opengraph template

Unlikely
========
- Twitter cards -- similar to opengraph data ? Needs Twitter account for approval :/
